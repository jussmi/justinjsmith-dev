>Hey, you think I should pick a .me or .us domain for my personal site?

How I wish I had gotten the answer "dot m. e."

Turns out, you cannot add Whois protection to a .us domain. My phone number and one of my emails are just out there... for anyone. My phone has been ringing off the hook with spam calls since an hour after I bought the domain. Spam emails. Spam texts. I'm assuming I'll get spam snail mail too.

Buy anything else that allows whois protection. Good grief.
