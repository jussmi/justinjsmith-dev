>Hey, you think I should pick a .me or .us domain for my personal site?

How I wish I had gotten the answer "dot m. e."

Turns out, you cannot add Whois protection to a .us domain. My phone number and one of my emails are just out there... for anyone. My phone has been ringing off the hook with spam calls since an hour after I bought the domain. Spam emails. Spam texts. I'm assuming I'll get spam snail mail too.

Buy anything else that allows whois protection. Good grief.

Well, Namecheap customer support gets a B+ for this one. They were able to remove my information from the domain and disassociate my account with it. I no longer own that domain, but the calls stopped within 12 hours.

New url is going to be justinjsmith.dev. It requires a https, but Netlify will handle that in the next post.
