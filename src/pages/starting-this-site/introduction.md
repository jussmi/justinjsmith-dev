I wanted to start a personal site. A site to host my resume, and serve as a place to write down things for myself.

My career trajectory is one where my skills don't match the titles I've held, so I wanted to give myself a place to show some of those as well.

I'm going to build this site with [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/ "Jamstack") starting with the excellent [Flask Static Tutorial](https://github.com/DeadWisdom/flask-static-tutorial "DeadWisdom's Flask Static Tutorial") from GitHub user DeadWisdom.

This post will be amended and appended as the project continues.

##### 2021-04-29 Update

I generated a favicon using the [favicon.io generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) by [johnsorrentino](https://twitter.com/johnsorrentino)

Realizing that this post will get massive if I provide the level of detail I'm intending. I am going to split these to a folder and sequence them.

Splitting them into a folder was easy _after_ I realized I needed to type the Flask route variable as a path.

Probably a disservice to introdcutions to call this an "Introduction"
